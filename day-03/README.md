# Day 3: Gear Ratios

Tried a new thing: `GeneratedRegex`. As for the code, I didn't feel like doing
optimizations after finding the right answers.

I simply create a 'bounding box' around the numbers to find out if it's a 
partnumber. For the second part I create a map of all gears and their adjacent
numbers.
