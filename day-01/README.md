~~Not the most efficient solution, especially for part 2, since it's not necessary
to 'normalize' the entire string. You could just find the first occurrence where
it's either a digit or a string-based digit.~~

Rewritten part two using a regex to find the occurrence of a digit, wether its'
a string-based digit or a digit itself. Then 'lookup' the found string to get 
the actual digit.
