# Day 7: Camel Cards

Using a _primary constructor_ for the first time. Pretty neat. Tried to use Linq
again and features like _return switch_ and _pattern matching_.

Overall pretty pleased with the result. I spent a little to much time figuring
out why the answer for part 2 was wrong. I had overlooked the case where the
hand consisted of 5 joker cards.
