# Day 18: Lavaduct Lagoon

At first, for part 1, I put all the points in a grid and then flood filled the
area. Count all the points and that's the answer. 

For part 2, that of course didnt work. Research lead me to the shoelace formula.
But with this problem, I will give the wrong answer, since half of the perimeter
is missing. Calculate that and divde by 2. Add an extra 1.

Ow, and it's a big number.
